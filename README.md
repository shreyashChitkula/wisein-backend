See `.env.example` for complete configuration.

## 💡 Key Features

### Authentication
- Email signup with OTP verification
- JWT-based login with refresh tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control

### Verification
- DigiLocker for Indian users
- Stripe Identity for international users
- Video upload with frame extraction
- Admin approval workflow


### Payments
- Generic payment integration (Cashfree sandbox by default)
- Payment order creation via API and UI
- Webhook handling
- Stripe & Razorpay support (optional)

## 🆕 Generic Payment Integration (Cashfree)

The payment module is now generic and can be used anywhere in the app. Subscription logic has been removed.

### Usage

#### 1. Creating a Payment Order (API)

Send a POST request to `/api/payment/order` with:
```
{
   "amount": 1000,
   "currency": "INR",
   "phone": "9876543210"
}
```
Authentication is currently disabled for testing. The backend uses a dummy userId.

#### 2. Testing Payment via UI

Open `http://localhost:3002/test-payment.html` in your browser. Fill in payment details and submit to test the payment flow.

#### 3. Environment Variables

Set these in `.env`:
- `CASHFREE_API_KEY_PAYMENT`
- `CASHFREE_API_SECRET_PAYMENT`
- `CASHFREE_BASE_URL_PAYMENT`

### Notes
- Payment orders use Cashfree sandbox credentials.
- The payment module is decoupled from business logic and reusable.
- Re-enable authentication for production use.

## License

Nest is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Docker / Compose (recommended for local testing)

This backend includes a multistage `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` in this folder. The compose file starts a Postgres database and the backend service (built from the `Dockerfile`). The builder stage runs `npx prisma generate` and builds the Nest app so the final image contains the compiled `dist` and generated Prisma client.

Prerequisites
- Docker Engine (install from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- docker-compose (Docker Desktop includes this; `docker compose` or `docker-compose` is fine)

Quick start (run from the `backend/` folder)

```bash
# Build and start in foreground (use -d to detach)
docker-compose up --build

# OR run detached
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Using an env file
If you prefer to keep secrets/config out of the compose file you can pass an env file:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env up --build -d
```

Check logs & status

```bash
# View backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# See running containers
docker ps

# Stop and remove containers (preserves volume by default)
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove containers + volumes (clears DB data)
docker-compose down -v
```

Apply database migrations (recommended)

The compose file does not auto-apply migrations. After the DB is up, run migrations from your host (recommended) or inside the container:

```bash
# From host (recommended - uses your local prisma cli)
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Or inside the backend container (after `docker-compose up`):
docker-compose exec backend npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Regenerate Prisma client

If you change `prisma/schema.prisma` you must regenerate the Prisma client and rebuild the image. Locally:

```bash
npx prisma generate
docker-compose build backend
docker-compose up -d
```

Notes & production tips
- The compose file in this folder is designed for local development and testing. For production deployments:
   - Run migrations from CI or a separate migration job rather than on container startup.
   - Use secrets or environment variable stores instead of checked-in `.env` files.
   - Consider building the image in CI and pushing to a registry, then deploying the image.

If you only push the `backend/` folder to a remote repo, the `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `prisma/` folder and `package.json` are all present so the image can be built using the same steps above.
